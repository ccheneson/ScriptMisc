GmailAsRead
=============

I like seeing the count of my emails down to 0 so that I can easily see if I have new emails or not.

I suscribe to many mailing lists, news letter, advertisements... and often, I dont set those emails as read
as I may be too lazy :), or too busy to do something else

This script is used to set automatically all emails with a status of _UNREAD_ to a status of _READ_

How to use it (using GroovyConsole):
- Download the mail.jar [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index.html) and add this library to the classpath of the GroovyConsole
- Open the script from the GroovyConsole and put your credentials for _username_ and _password_ variables. 
- Click the button _Execute Groovy Script_
